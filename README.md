## Overview
This is a demo course website that teaches IT knowledge (mainly about Web and App). The website is quite simple, with a few typical features such as: displaying courses, posting courses on the homepage, editing, deleting courses and restoring or permanently deleting courses. There are some features I will update in the future because this is only a test version.
## Feature
I have built many features for the web, some of it can be listed here:
- Displaying courses
- Posting courses on the homepage
- Editing, deleting (soft delete) courses
- Restoring or permanently deleting courses 
To see more about the features, please read the How to use section.
## How to use
-	When you log in to the website, the home page will display the available courses

-	You can look at the side of the screen where your avatar icon is located. Next to the avatar there is a triangle icon, click on it to select the function you want to use.

-	In turn in the list are post courses (when you want to post a course), my courses (courses you have posted or participated in), my articles (where you share information about programming knowledge). process) and finally the logout function.
-	Currently, I have just built the function to post courses on the website, delete courses, and edit courses.
## Function
-	When you click on the image or title of the course on the interface, you will be taken directly to the course information as follows:

-	Because there isn't much information yet, the content in the course may be sketchy, which I can fix in the future.

-	Regarding the edit function: when you access it, there will be content boxes corresponding to the course you want to edit before reposting to the website.

-	Regarding deleting courses, there are functions such as selecting the number of courses you want to delete by checking the checkbox or selecting all by simply clicking the checkbox all.
